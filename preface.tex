Welcome to the \emph{13th ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Virtual Machines and Intermediate Languages (VMIL 2021)}. The workshop is co-located with SPLASH'21 and will be held as a hybrid event in Chicago, US.
The workshop aims at advancing the state of the art on the design and implementation of programming systems, with virtual machines---broadly defined---as a focus.
VMIL could attract a sizable number of seven submissions this year, after a submission low due to COVID-19 last year.

The workshop had two submission deadlines. The first deadline was intended for mature work to be published as part of these proceedings.
The second deadline was intended for work-in-progress papers, new ideas, and emerging results.
In total, the workshop attracted two full-length papers, four work-in-progress papers, and one position paper.
Each paper received three reviews.
The program committee accepted the two full-length papers and three work-in-progress papers for presentation in the workshop.
Additionally, three of these papers were submitted for publication and archival in the ACM DL.
Additionally, this year, we have invited three speakers from industry and academia to give keynotes.

We would like to thank the authors for their submission, and all program
committee members for their high-quality and insightful reviews. Finally, we thank
all attendees for their participation.
