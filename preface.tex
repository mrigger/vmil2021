Welcome to the ...: One paragraph with conference or workshop title and acronym, location, date, co-located with ICLI 2017, and main focus.

More paragraphs with information on goals, scope, relation to previous workshops, invited talks, sessions/topics, and thanks (program committee, ...).

One paragraph explaining the review process, how many reviewers per paper, how were submissions of PC members treated, and statistics (numbers of submissions and accepted papers).

All material should fit within a rectangle of 18 × 23.5 cm (7" × 9.25"), centred on the page. Short welcome messages can use a smaller text area.

\textbf{ACM}: The titles (Biolinum, sans-serif, 18 point, bold), the headings (Biolinum, sans-serif, 14 point, bold), 
and the text (Libertine, serif, 12 point) fill the full width of the page – one column.
\textbf{IEEE}: The titles (Helvetica/Arial, 18 point, bold), the headings (Helvetica/Arial, 14 point, bold), 
and the text (Times New Roman, 12 point) fill the full width of the page – one column.

No classifiers and no copyright block at the bottom of the first page are needed. No transfer of copyright or permission release is necessary.

Page numbers should be omitted.

Text and URLs should be in black, not in blue/other color, and not underlined.

If the submission system asks for an abstract, please copy the first paragraph of the welcome message (or whatever is appropriate) as abstract. This will be shown as description in HTML navigation structures.

The deadline for submission of this preface is one week after the camera-ready paper deadline for the papers.
